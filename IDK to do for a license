What I want:
You can copy and use any of MY code (with credit if it's a whole class)
don't copy original ideas such as uniqe enemies without credit
If anything I come up with turns out to not be a new idea simply inform me (via GitHub for now)
Account for licenses of used libraries ect. (Including as dependencies of copied code(as in items 1&2))
